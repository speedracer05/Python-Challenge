# Python-Challenge

The project involves the creation of a Python script to analyze the financial records of your a fictiious company named PyBank. The task is to analyze the records from a csv file and calculate the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

List and String variables were created. I then used two forLoops; one to calculate the change in revenue over the period, and using it to create a list; the other was used to find the greatest gain and decrease in revenue, as well as calculate the change in revenue.  

## Getting Started

You will need to load the Python script main.py. into an editor. Visual Studio was used to create this script. A resource file named budget_data.csv was used to extract the data.

The following output will be printed to the terminal:
Total Months: 86
Total Revenue: $38382578
Average Revenue Change: $6269
Greatest Increase in Profit: Feb-2012 ($1926159) 
Greatest Decrease in Profit: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

In addition a text file of the same output is written to a file named, "Report_PyBank.txt"
